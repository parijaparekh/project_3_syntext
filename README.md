# synText

synText is a web based application that provides digitization of stickies/notes. 

The current deployment is designed to work within an organization hence signup is not provided. 

The right to add users and modify user settings is with manager/admin. 

## User Story

An authorised user can create notes and assign it to self or other members of the team. 

Authorised user can list all the notes assigned to them and edit them. 

Notes should have a state; either complete or open. During its lifecycle the note moves across these two states.  

Only an Admin/Manager can create and modify the users information. 

Users once linked with notes cannot be deleted from the system. But they can be deactivated. 

This application should be installable. Hence PWA should be incorporated.
